<p>Having grown up in a family of small farmers and workers, I live with my family very close to our rural roots.
As a Christian, theologian and protestant pastor (retired since autumn 2022), I am influenced by Lutheranism, a very critical socio-political attitude in the wake of the Marburg Genius Loci and a cosmopolitan pietism of the Zinzendorf type.
Since the beginning of my retirement I can follow my theological as well as some political commitments very conscientiously and freely. Advising former students and offering public presentations on themes from Ecumenism, African Theology and churches, Mission Studies and especially Intercultural Theology is my pleasure. Assisting in our local Protestant congregation by occasional preaching and adult educational work too. Together with my wife I enjoy very much taking care of our grandchildren, singing with others, e.g. Paul Gerhardt chorales, I also like listening to Bach, pop music (also from my "second home" Tanzania), which I also like to dance to; 
I sometimes devour novels and have been a passionate jogger and soccer fan since my youth.</p>
