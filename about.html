<p>Having grown up in a family of small farmers and workers, I live with my family very close to our rural roots.
As a Christian, theologian and protestant pastor (retired since autumn 2022), I am influenced by Lutheranism, a very critical socio-political attitude in the wake of the Marburg Genius Loci and a cosmopolitan pietism of the Zinzendorf type.
I enjoy singing with others, e.g. Paul Gerhardt chorales, I also like listening to Bach, pop music (also from my "second home" Tanzania), which I also like to dance to; 
I sometimes devour novels and have been a passionate jogger and soccer fan since my youth.</p>
